# Nutrition_Agent
The nutrition agent, which measures and calculates the diet plan and health related queries for the users.

Problem Statement:
 In an era of growing health awareness, individuals seek personalized nutrition guidance. Existing tools offer
 generic plans and lack adaptability to lifestyle, allergies, or cultural preferences. Scalability remains a
 challenge for nutritionists. There's a need for an AI assistant that offers dynamic, interactive, and tailored diet
 planning using natural language, image, or voice input

 Proposed Solution:
 Our Nutrition Agent is an AI-driven assistant that uses IBM Granite (LLMs) and IBM Cloud Lite to provide:- Personalized meal plans based on health goals, conditions, and preferences- Smart food swaps and contextual nutritional advice- Dynamic adaptation based on continuous feedback- Multimodal input: text, image, and voice
 Powered by RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), it pulls real-time data from trusted sources.
